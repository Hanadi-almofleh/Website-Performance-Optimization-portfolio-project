## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

# Steps of Optimaization 
you can find the link of we page [here](https://hanadi-almofleh.github.io/Website-Performance-Optimization-portfolio-project/)

[pizza](https://hanadi-almofleh.github.io/Website-Performance-Optimization-portfolio-project/views/pizza.html)

the origional code, could be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio)
## Main page (index)
 - inline styles.css to html
 - remove link to google font
 - add media print to print.css stylsheet
 - optimize and copress the images
 - minify html
---



## view page (Pizza page)
Two main subject are modified, one for scolling the page and other for slide pizza size.
those using functions updatePositions() and changePizzaSizes(size). below detail for each subject.

### 1-  update position 
##### At event after DOM content Load: 
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() 

- instead of calling update position function after DOM content Load, just assign the position value while creating the element as below line.
 > elem.style.left = elem.basicLeft + 'px';
- also reduce number of elements make the 25 instead 200.
- add hight and width in style file.

##### At event Scroll

in the function updatePositions(), calculate the style value outside the loop to avoid FSL

---
### 2- change pizza size 
- calculate pizza width outside the loop. 
- remove unndeeded code like determineDx.
